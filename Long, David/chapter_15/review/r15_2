A checked exception is one that must be dealt with in the code, either with
a "throws" declaration or a "try-catch" statement.

An unchecked exception is one that does not have to be dealt with. If one
such exception is thrown, usually it is attributed to the errors in the code.

NullPointerException is unchecked

Checked Exceptions are declared with the throws keyword.
